Description: Detect the molecular pathways associated with the expression levels of 
    the target circRNAs. Transcriptome unsupervised and supervised analyses is performed 
    and samples with high with those with low expression of the interested circRNA were compared obtaining 
    genes differtially expressed in relation to circRNA pattern.
